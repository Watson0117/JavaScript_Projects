Projects
1. Calculator
   This project is a basic calculator. It functions as it should. I changed the fonts and colors for the calculator to make it a cool blue.
   
2. Pizza menu
   My pizza menu project. It allows for the selection of several different toppings and sizes. It then returns a list of what was selected and the totaled price.

4. Tic Tack toe application
    This is a fairly simple tic tac toe application. It automatically resets when the game is done. I changed the icons of X/O to crossed swords and shields.

5. Portfolio project
    My portfolio is a breakdown of what I have learned so far. It has a slideshow, popup contact form, as well as videos and styling throughout.
